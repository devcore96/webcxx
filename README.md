# WebCXX
WebCXX is an in-development modern C++ web back-end built upon CgiCC which expands on many of the missing features, while providing a more robust framework containing all the features requiried to be actually usable on a production website.
The purpose of this project is to provide a highly performant and optimized back-end framework for high-traffic applications that are willing to trade compilation time for better performance and lower resource overhead.

- [x] JSON parsing
